# backtracking-algorithm
This code shows a backtracking algorithm designed to identify the largest island in an ocean. Land is represented by 1's and water by 0's and maps are stored in a 2-d array.
The algorithm checks island by island labeling them as it goes. Then it finds the label which covers the most land and identifies that as the largest island.
